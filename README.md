## Data
Files associated with creation of the database, and entry of data, are found in the `/data` directory.
These include SQL files to create and remove the schema, and various programs to convert data sources (CSV files, PDF files, Shapefiles, etc.) into appropriate SQL commands to enter data into the database.
Because these SQL files are automatically be generated, and because they are fairly lengthy, they will be git ignored.
Note that this depends on the data sources (CSV files, PDF files, Shapefiles, etc.) in the `/datasources` directory, which are intentionally also git ignored because of their size.
To get access to these files, reach out to Will McCoy (willway09).
